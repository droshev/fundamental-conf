They often have no choice but use our software - it comes along with the job - in contrast to consumer software, where users can choose what apps they use. And in today’s world of hybrid, flexible work, the barrier between work and private life has blurred like never before.

Nrwl NX is a technology aimed to help you every step of the way. In this talk, we will have a look at how it can help you to work effortlessly with projects of any size.\\n\\nhttps://sap-se.zoom.us/j/93979836058\r\nDTSTART:20220929T171000Z\r\nDTEND:20220929T174000Z\r\nCLASS:PUBLIC\r\nPRIORITY:5\r\nDTSTAMP:20220916T213732Z\r\nTRANSP:OPAQUE\r\nSTATUS:CONFIRMED\r\nLOCATION:https://sap-se.zoom.us/j/93979836058\r\nX-MICROSOFT-CDO-BUSYSTATUS:BUSY\r\nX-MICROSOFT-CDO-INTENDEDSTATUS:BUSY\r\nX-MICROSOFT-CDO-ALLDAYEVENT:FALSE\r\nX-MICROSOFT-CDO-IMPORTANCE:1\r\nX-MICROSOFT-CDO-INSTTYPE:0\r\nX-MICROSOFT-DONOTFORWARDMEETING:FALSE\r\nX-MICROSOFT-DISALLOW-COUNTER:FALSE\r\nX-MICROSOFT-LOCATIONDISPLAYNAME:https://sap-se.zoom.us/j/93979836058\r\nBEGIN:VALARM\r\nDESCRIPTION:REMINDER\r\nTRIGGER;RELATED=START:-PT10M\r\nACTION:DISPLAY\r\nEND:VALARM\r\nEND:VEVENT\r\nEND:VCALENDAR\r\n"

And yet, despite there being lots of guides on how to do it and a plethora of testing frameworks, it still seems like setting up, writing and running E2E tests becomes a chore more often than not. Even worse, modern web application development requires support for different features like opening new tabs or working with iframes for microfrontends which exacerbates the problems. Playwright is a modern E2E testing framework which supports all modern rendering engines (Chromium, WebKit and Firefox) and all platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS), either headed or headless, locally or on CI. Tests can be written in TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, .NET and Java. It features automated waiting on DOM elements, retryable assertions, reaches every part of the (shadow) DOM and a great toolkit with the possibilities of generating tests by recording actions, doing detailed test inspection and viewing recorder traces of tests. Working with multiple tabs, contexts, users and iframes is easy and Playwright has a big following on GitHub while being backed by Microsoft. Writing tests in Playwright is straightforward and based on Promises without the usage of extendable global objects or magic.",
